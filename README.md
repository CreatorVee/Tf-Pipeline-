 DevOps E2E Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps pipeline using Terraform, Ansible, Python, Jenkins, AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker.
The goal is to show how different DevOps tools work together to automate infrastructure, configuration, validation, and deployment.

 Project Overview

This project ties together infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, validation, and CI/CD automation into a single workflow.

üîë Key Features

Terraform creates AWS EKS clusters

Ansible automates node configuration (placeholder in this repo)

Python validates variables/configurations

Jenkins runs the pipeline end-to-end

AWS + Kubernetes + Docker for scalable cloud deployments

‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>

---

2. Run Terraform
terraform init
terraform apply --auto-approve

---

3. Run Python Validation
python3 validate.py

---

4Ô∏è.  Run Ansible Playbook
ansible-playbook playbook.yml

---

5. Jenkins Pipeline

Runs Python validation

Runs Ansible playbook

Applies Terraform provisioning

‚úÖ Problems & Solutions
Terraform

Problem (Before): Setting up infrastructure like EKS clusters manually on AWS was time-consuming and error-prone.
Solution (Now): Terraform automates infrastructure creation with code (Infrastructure as Code).

Ansible

Problem (Before): Nodes had to be configured manually.
Solution (Now): Ansible automates configuration (placeholder here).

Python

Problem (Before): No quick way to validate variables before deploying.
Solution (Now): Python script validates variables/configs to prevent mistakes.

Jenkins

Problem (Before): Running steps manually was slow and error-prone.
Solution (Now): Jenkins automates the workflow in a pipeline.

AWS + Kubernetes + Docker

Problem (Before): Running apps only locally limited scalability.
Solution (Now): Cloud-native stack provides scalability, consistency, and reliability.
